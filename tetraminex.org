**** Ernie: Why are you in my dorm room?
**** What your name is, young man?
**** Ernie Goldsmile, and I'm about to call the cops.
**** Please, Ernie Goldsmile. Let me tell you story.
**** I am innocent. I had family. I had my pride. I did not run from my accusers.
Level: Ivan was in jail when the aliens came.
The JellInvaders extracted everyone in the building.
**** But how did you survive?
*** level: time travel fighting.
**** my father, cyan vladovitch found it in ukraine
**** i was protector. i help people.
**** the monsters, everywhere

"You mean you really have a teleporter?"

**** Who is this Ivan you keep mentioning?
**** Ivan Punchko. He's your son!
**** Oscar? My Oscar is here? I looked for him, but.

Lucy and Teddy and Griselda are all overjoyed.
Ivan's off to the side. Ernie goes to him.
There's someone you need to meet.
** E20 Letters from Home
The last episode is correspondance between Ernie and Emily, where she
fills him in on the news back home.

Ernie sees the world as puzzles now. Tetraminex becomes a metaphor for
his life, or the problems in the world as the aliens are integrated.

Each puzzle is abstract, but somehow related to the fate of a character.
Last one is about getting back to Emily.

The final scene is their wedding.

Then a fade to black, and:

                              TETRAMINEX

                              GAME OVER
