* 2: Playtesting
** FlxReplay
http://flixel.org/docs/org/flixel/system/FlxReplay.html

** Mechanical Turk
https://requester.mturk.com/developer
http://aws.amazon.com/code/446 # python example



* 3: New mechanisms
** conveyor belts
*** automatically move boxes
*** timing puzzle with lifts/pushers?
** gravity
*** falling
*** jumping
*** ladders
*** Crane
moves back and forth and lifts blocks from the top
*** power lifts
platforms that go up and down from the bottom
*** wrapping (like wrecking crew)
*** powerup: lift blocks overhead like smb 2?
*** powerup: teleport to top/bottom of screen
*** powerup: remote control
press 0..9 to move corresponding lift
....or other devices??? :)
** grappling hook:
*** suteF style
*** hook passes through walls?
** raw materials: dominos and trominos
*** blobs
Raw material for blocks. These would merge together on contact.
*** rotation
Once you have more than a block, it makes sense to rotate.
*** cutting
Powerup to separate blocks that get stuck together?
** ghosts
*** backstory for ghosts?
*** ghost blocks
** dispenser
*** these could force you to solve the puzzle in a particular order
